Simple app to automatically switch scenes in OBS based on the current bitrate fetched from an RTMP server's stats page.

-   [norip.io](https://www.norip.io)

## Build Prerequisities

-   [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
-   [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)

> This script uses OBS plugin "obs-websocket" in conjunction with "OBS-Studio". For monitoring "NGINX-RTMP" (see links below).

-   [OBS-Studio](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/)
-   [OBS-WEBSOCKET](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-websocket/)

> It supports monitoring streams on either NGINX-RTMP server or Node-Media-Server. Node-Media-Server is also built into NOALBS for an easy all-in-one streaming solution.

-   [NGINX-RTMP](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module/)
-   [Node-Media-Server](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server/)

## Installation from Source

-   `git clone <repository-url>` or download from [RELEASES](https://github.com/715209/nginx-obs-automatic-low-bitrate-switching/releases)
-   Change into the new directory.
-   `npm install --production`

If you already have NGINX-RTMP server
-   Replace your `nginx.conf` with the one given here.
-   Put `stat.xsl` in your nginx folder.

Otherwise here is a Windows version of NGINX+RTMP Server
- [Hosted on Github](https://github.com/715209/nginx-obs-automatic-low-bitrate-switching/raw/master/nginx/nginx_1.7.11.3_Gryphon_With_NOALBS.config_files_03162020.zip)
- Everything is ready to go inside this zip, just extract and click on the `nginx_start.bat` file to start NGINX, you can use `nginx_stop.bat` to stop NGINX. HTTP server runs on Port `80`, RTMP server runs on `1935`, if you need to edit the config file it's in the `/conf` folder, named `nginx.conf`.

## Config

Edit `config.json` to your own settings.

Here is an example config with comments (click to enlarge):

**_PLEASE NOTE CONFIG MAY NOT REPRESENT CURRENT CONFIG_**

-   Use https://twitchapps.com/tmi to get your oauth from Twitch for use with chat commands.
    > We recommend using your main Twitch BOT account for this, but if you do not have a Twitch Bot account just use your Main Twitch Account.

Also if you are going to be using your Twitch BOT Account please make sure it is an 'Editor' of your channel, see example;

Go to this URL: [Twitch User Roles](https://www.twitch.tv/dashboard/roles/), Find your bot on the list, add checkmark to 'Editor', done.

## How to run from source

Run the node app by running: `npm start`. Then stream to `rtmp://IPHERE/publish/live`

## Chat Commands

This script gives you the option to enable some simple chat commands to help you manage your stream from your own Twitch chat, here is how to use them:

> Please note: Admins are all the users in the "adminUsers" array in the config, MODs (if enabled in the config) are all of your MODs, and Public (if enabled in the config) is anyone in your chat.

> | Default Role | Command                               | Description                                                                                             | Example              |

> |    Admins    | !autostop (on/off) | enables/disables the auto stop feature when you host/raid. | !autostop on |

## Running with Node-Media-Server
### Using the inbuilt server
Defining a nodeMediaServer block in config.json will enable a fully functional node-media-server RTMP server to accept incoming streams:

```
    "rtmp": {
        "application": "publish",
        "key": "live"
    },
    "nodeMediaServer": {
        "rtmp": {
            "port": 1935,
            "chunk_size": 60000,
            "gop_cache": true,
            "ping": 30,
            "ping_timeout": 60
        },
        "http": {
            "port": 8000
        }
    },
```

> The `nodeMediaServer` object is passed directly as the node-media-server configuration, [more details here](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server#npm-version-recommended). It will also automatically fill out the rtmp server type and stats fields.

> Note: This is probably best for local connections and testing only unless you [enable authentication](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server#authentication)

### Using an external server
Modify the RTMP section in config.json like this to connect to a node-media-server running externally:

```
    "rtmp": {
        "server": "node-media-server",
        "stats": "http://localhost:8000/api/streams",
        "application": "publish",
        "key": "live"
    },
```

## Using nimble SRT instead of nginx rtmp

Nimble must have [API access enabled](https://wmspanel.com/nimble/api) and be configured as a SRT receiver - see ["Set up receiving of SRT"](https://blog.wmspanel.com/2017/07/setup-srt-secure-reliable-transport-nimble-streamer.html) and have an outgoing stream ("Add outgoing stream" on same page)

Modify the RTMP section in config.json to this:

```
    "rtmp": {
        "server": "nimble",
        "stats": "http://nimble:8082",
        "id": "0.0.0.0:1234",
        "application": "live",
        "key": "srt"
    },
```

- `stats`: URL to nimble API
- `id`: UDP listener ID (Usually IP:Port)
- `application`: Outgoing stream "Application Name"
- `key`: Outgoing stream "Stream Name"

---

Switches on low bitrate or high RTT (high RTT seems to be a more accurate way of determining if the stream is bad with this)

You can change the high RTT trigger value inside config.json:

```
    "obs": {
        ...
        "highRttTrigger": 2500,
    },
```

## Help it won't change scenes

It will only change scenes when OBS is set on a scene that's in the config.  
(This is so that it wont change when you are on for example your 'intro' or 'locked-brb' scene)
